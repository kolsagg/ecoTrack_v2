Okay, I will revise the Frontend PRD to ensure better alignment and compatibility with the Backend PRD we've been working on. The main goal is to make sure the frontend tasks correctly anticipate the data and endpoints provided by the FastAPI backend.

Here's the revised Frontend PRD:

## 1. Introduction

This document details all functional and technical tasks **to be performed** during the frontend development (User Interface and Mobile Device-Specific Functions) of the "QR-Based Digital Expense Tracking Application" mobile app. The project aims to enable users to digitally track their expenses via QR codes, offer AI-powered financial insights, and adopt an eco-friendly approach. This document focuses on the mobile application layer, which will be developed using Flutter, and its interaction with the FastAPI/Supabase backend.

## 4. Frontend Development Tasks (Flutter)

This section lists all UI development, user interaction, and Backend integration tasks to be performed using Flutter.

### 4.1. Core Application Infrastructure and Configuration
*   [ ] **Task:** Create Flutter project structure and add dependencies (e.g., `http` or `dio` for network requests, a state management solution like Provider/Bloc/Riverpod, a charting library like `fl_chart`, `flutter_secure_storage`).
*   [ ] **Task:** Select and implement a state management solution for the application.
*   [ ] **Task:** Implement the application theme and style guide (colors, typography, spacing) based on UI/UX designs.
*   [ ] **Task:** Set up configuration management for different environments (development, production) to handle backend API URLs (e.g., `GET /api/...`).

### 4.2. User Authentication and Account Management Interfaces
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop User Registration (Sign-up) screen (fields: email, password).
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Calls `POST /api/auth/register`.
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop User Login screen (fields: email, password).
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Calls `POST /api/auth/login`.
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop Password Reset/Forgot Password flow screens.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Calls `POST /api/auth/reset-password` (to request) and potentially a screen for confirming the reset if the backend flow requires it (e.g. `POST /api/auth/reset-password-confirm` if implemented).
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup and entry screens (if 2FA is implemented in the backend).

    *   **Backend Interaction:** Sends scanned QR data to `POST /api/receipts/scan`.
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop an interface to preview scanned QR code data (if feasible to show meaningful raw data) and allow users to confirm or make minor adjustments before submission.
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop a detailed form interface for manual expense/receipt entry (fields: merchant name, date, items with description, amount, quantity, category, notes).
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Sends data to `POST /api/expenses` (backend will auto-create receipt).
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop an interface to display a list of categories (fetched from backend) and allow users to select one for an expense.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Fetches categories via `GET /api/categories`.
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop an interface for users to add/edit/delete their custom categories.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** `POST /api/categories`, `PUT /api/categories/{category_id}`, `DELETE /api/categories/{category_id}`.

### 4.4. Expense Viewing and Management Interfaces
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop the main receipts screen displaying a list of all digitized receipts.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Fetches data via `GET /api/receipts` (supports pagination, filtering).

*   [ ] **Task:** Implement UI for editing and deleting expenses.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** `PUT /api/expenses/{expense_id}`, `DELETE /api/expenses/{expense_id}`.

### 4.5. Financial Analysis and Visualization Interfaces
*   [ ] **Task:** Develop a main dashboard screen (displaying an overview of spending, recent activity, key insights).
*   [ ] **Task:** Implement interactive charts (e.g., pie chart, bar chart using `fl_chart`) to display spending distribution by category or merchant.
    *   **Backend Interaction:** Fetches data via `GET /api/reports/spending-distribution`.
*   [ ] **Task:** Implement line charts to display spending trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).

*   [ ] **Task:** Implement serialization/deserialization logic (e.g., using `json_serializable`) to convert JSON data from APIs into Dart data models (PODOs - Plain Old Dart Objects).
*   [ ] **Task:** Implement logic to prepare and send user inputs (form data, filter parameters) in the correct format for Backend API calls.
*   [ ] **Task:** Integrate authentication API calls (`POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`). Securely store the JWT token (e.g., using `flutter_secure_storage`) and include it in the headers of subsequent authenticated API requests.
